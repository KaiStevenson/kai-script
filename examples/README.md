## A guided tour of KaiScript through examples

Open this in your IDE of choice--make sure your LSP is running so you can inspect types. Feel free to run `tsx` on each file to verify the runtime outputs.
If you're reading this without an LSP, I've added type annotations in comments above each result. I promise these match what you'd see if you hovered over the value!

1. [Breaking the second wall](./mapper.ts)

2. [Code that does stuff](./runtime.ts)

3. [Useful code](./createFn.ts)

4. [Turing completeness](./branching.ts)

5. [Infinite computation](./recursion.ts)

6. [Infinite transformation](./mapReduce.ts)
